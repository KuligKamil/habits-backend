type Query {
  sessions(startDate: String!, endDate: String!): [Session!]!
  users(startDate: String!, endDate: String!): [User!]!
  pageViews(startDate: String!, endDate: String!): [PageView!]!
}

type Session {
  id: ID!
  startTime: DateTime!
  endTime: DateTime!
  duration: Int!
  user: User!
  pageViews: [PageView!]!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  sessionId: ID!
  firstSession: DateTime!
  lastSession: DateTime!
  pageViews: [PageView!]!
}

type PageView {
  id: ID!
  time: DateTime!
  url: String!
  pageTitle: String!
  user: User!
  session: Session!
}
In this example schema, we have three main types: Session, User, and PageView. Each type has its own fields that define its properties, such as id, startTime, endTime, duration, url, pageTitle, and so on. We also have a Query type that defines the entry points for retrieving data. We can query for sessions, users, or page views for a specific date range using their startDate and endDate.

The Session type represents a single session, which is a group of user interactions with a website that occur within a given time frame. A session has a unique id, a start and end time, a duration, and a list of page views.

The User type represents a unique user who visits a website. A user has a unique id, a sessionId that represents the first session they visited the site, a firstSession and lastSession time, and a list of page views.

The PageView type represents a single page view that occurs within a session. A page view has a unique id, a time, a URL, a page title, and references to the associated user and session.

Again, this is just an example schema, and in a real-world scenario, it can be much more complex and can include additional types, fields, and queries. But this should give you an idea of how GraphQL can model data from Google Analytics.


Sure, here's an updated example schema that includes Country and Region types:

yaml
Copy code
type Query {
  sessions(startDate: String!, endDate: String!): [Session!]!
  users(startDate: String!, endDate: String!): [User!]!
  pageViews(startDate: String!, endDate: String!): [PageView!]!
  countries: [Country!]!
  regions: [Region!]!
}

type Session {
  id: ID!
  startTime: DateTime!
  endTime: DateTime!
  duration: Int!
  user: User!
  pageViews: [PageView!]!
  country: Country!
  region: Region!
}f

type User {
  id: ID!
  sessionId: ID!
  firstSession: DateTime!
  lastSession: DateTime!
  pageViews: [PageView!]!
  country: Country!
  region: Region!
}

type PageView {
  id: ID!
  time: DateTime!
  url: String!
  pageTitle: String!
  user: User!
  session: Session!
  country: Country!
  region: Region!
}

type Country {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  code: String!
  sessions: [Session!]!
  users: [User!]!
  pageViews: [PageView!]!
  regions: [Region!]!
}

type Region {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  code: String!
  country: Country!
  sessions: [Session!]!
  users: [User!]!
  pageViews: [PageView!]!
}
In this updated schema, we have two new types: Country and Region. Each PageView, User, and Session now has a reference to a Country and Region. The Country type represents a country and has a code property that represents the country's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. The Region type represents a region within a country and has a code property that represents the region's ISO 3166-2 code.

Both Country and Region types have sessions, users, and pageViews fields, which are lists of sessions, users, and page views associated with the country or region.

Again, this is just an example schema, and in a real-world scenario, it can be much more complex and can include additional types, fields, and queries. But this should give you an idea of how GraphQL can model data from Google Analytics with the addition of countries and regions.
